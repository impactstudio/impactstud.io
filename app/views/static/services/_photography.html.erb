      <p class="lead">There is a saying the in the Internet Marketing community and that is, <strong>"Content is king!"</strong> referring to the high-quality text content being a big indicator of page ranking scores in search engines. Well, at impactstudio we say that <strong>"if content is king then image content is God lol!"</strong> But seriously, image and video content are crucial to a great user experience and the companies that invest in quality visual content for their website are usually the websites that people enjoy visiting the most. However, hiring a professional photographer or videographer to capture this type of content will undoubtedly cost a lot of money.</p>
      <p class="lead">With impactstudio our mission is to eliminate the need for hiring a photographer on the side who <strong>1)</strong> will almost always charge more than we will and <strong>2)</strong> may have a great eye for photography but does not have the vision for how a photograph will look on your website <em>(which takes a lot more brainstorming than someone would think)</em>. Our in-house photographers have the experience and the professional gear to take compositionally sound, web-optimized image content that can be included in our web design package at a very reasonable price.</p>
