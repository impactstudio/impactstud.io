      <p class="lead"><em>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</em> can simply be defined as the digital marketing effort to increase the search ranking of a website in search engines such Google, Bing, Yahoo etc.</em> a website without a clear-cut marketing and SEO plan is like an artist trying to sell their paintings in a gallery by putting them up in the storage closet in the back where no one is likely to see them. We will go as far to say that building a beautiful website is <strong>a waste of time and money</strong> for our clients without a proper SEO plan in place to lure potential customers back to the website. A great website paired with a relentless SEO plan is what we do best and it's what is needed for our clients to make their business standout in a sea of competitors.</p>
