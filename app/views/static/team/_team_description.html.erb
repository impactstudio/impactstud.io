          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">Jeremiah's career in Web Development started 4 years ago at a Web Agency who specialized in Corporate/Franchise Development. After 2 years he was promoted to Director of SEO and Social Media managing more than 50 clients with success. In addition, he helped with the creation and management of client Wordpress Templates. Towards the end of his career with Peak Studios he went back to school to learn more about the nuts and bolts of Web Develpment. From there he found that he had enough well rounded experience to start a company. Enter impactstudio.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">When he doesn't have his face glued to a text editor he thorougly enjoys the outdoors from climbing 14,000ft. mountains, to backcountry snowboarding and taking <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/JeremiahWodkePhotography/">landscape photographs</a> <em>(which somtimes entails standing on the side of cliffs or in freezing cold river water all to get that one perfect shot)</em>. Broadly stated, many people would say Jeremiah is an adventurous person.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">Jeremiah is also a very family-oriented person who spends the remaining time he has with his wife, family, close friends and pets.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">He is a strong advocate of the "Work Hard Play Hard" system.</p>

	  <p class="team-member-description center-image">Sam started developing around 6 years ago while attending college for a Computer Science degree. Life happened in the time he was attending school and this put a pause on the development career. While dabbling in code over the years and being furloughed while working for the railroad, Sam decided to take his coding hobby to a full time status and attended the prestigious Flatiron School in New York learning full stack web development. After he completed his education, Jeremiah and Sam decided to start a company helping small businesses achieve their goals.</p>
	  <p class="team-member-description center-image">When he isn't head first in a customers website, Sam enjoys playing guitar at Crossroads Church in Loveland, playing the occasional video game, and of course spending time with his ever growing family. As of right now Sam has one and a half kids (baby is due in May!), a ferret, two parrots, a dog, and one cat!</p>
	  <p class="team-member-description center-image">Be forwarned, if you ever meet these guys in real life, Sam will most likely be dressed like Spiderman. </p>
	  <p class="team-member-description center-image"><strong>Dont worry, it's awesome.</strong></p>
