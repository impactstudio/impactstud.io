          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">"My career in Web Development started 4 years ago at a Web Agency who specialized in Corporate/Franchise Developement. After 2 years I was promoted to Director of SEO and Social Media managing more than 50 clients with success. In addition, I helped with the creation and management of our clients Wordpress Templates. Towards the end of my career with Peak Studios I went back to school to learn more about the nuts and bolts of Web Develpment. From there I found that I had enough well rounded experience to start a company.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">When I don't have my face three inches from a computer monitor I thorougly enjoy the outdoors from hiking, snowboarding and taking landscape photographs. I strongly believe that getting out in nature has a tangible effect on my creativity especially with Web Development and Design. I'm also a very family-oriented dude who spends the remaining time with my beatuiful wife, close friends and some of the goofiest pets I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.</p>
