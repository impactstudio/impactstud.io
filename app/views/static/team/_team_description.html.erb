          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">Jeremiah's career in Web Development started 4 years ago at a Web Agency who specialized in Corporate/Franchise Development. After 2 years he was promoted to Director of SEO and Social Media managing more than 50 clients with success. In addition, he helped with the creation and management of client Wordpress Templates. Towards the end of his career with Peak Studios he went back to school to learn more about the nuts and bolts of Web Develpment. From there he found that he had enough well rounded experience to start a company. Enter impactstudio.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">When he doesn't have his face glued to a text editor he thorougly enjoys the outdoors from climbing 14,000ft. mountains, to backcountry snowboarding and taking <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/JeremiahWodkePhotography/">landscape photographs</a> <em>(which somtimes entails standing on the side of cliffs or in freezing cold river water all to get that one perfect shot)</em>. Broadly stated, many people would say Jeremiah is an adventurous person.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">Jeremiah is also a very family-oriented person who spends the remaining time he has with his wife, family, close friends and pets.</p>
          <p class="team-member-description first-team-member center-image">He is a strong advocate of the "Work Hard Play Hard" system.</p>

          <p class="team-member-description center-image">Sam is a rather unique character. Usually when we're trying to brainstorm ideas he prefers sitting in the corner picking his nose or making construction paper snowflakes. We're not actually sure why we keep him on.</p>
